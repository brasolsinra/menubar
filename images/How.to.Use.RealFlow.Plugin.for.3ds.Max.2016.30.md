## Step 1: Install RealFlow Plugin for 3ds Max 2016 30
 
To use RealFlow plugin for 3ds Max 2016 30, you need to have both RealFlow and 3ds Max installed on your computer. You can download RealFlow from [https://realflow.com/](https://realflow.com/) and 3ds Max from [https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview). After installing both software, you need to install the plugin from [https://realflow.com/realflow-3d-max-main-features/](https://realflow.com/realflow-3d-max-main-features/). Follow the instructions on the website to complete the installation process.
 
## Step 2: Create a Scene in 3ds Max
 
Once you have installed the plugin, you can launch 3ds Max and create a new scene or open an existing one. For this example, we will create a simple scene with a sphere and a plane. To create a sphere, go to Create > Geometry > Sphere and drag in the viewport. To create a plane, go to Create > Geometry > Plane and drag in the viewport. Adjust the size and position of the objects as you like.
 
## Step 3: Add RealFlow Objects and Daemons
 
To start using RealFlow plugin for 3ds Max 2016 30, you need to add RealFlow objects and daemons to your scene. RealFlow objects are special types of geometry that can interact with fluids, such as emitters, obstacles, containers, etc. RealFlow daemons are forces that can affect the behavior of fluids, such as gravity, wind, attraction, etc.
 
To add a RealFlow object or daemon, go to Create > Helpers > RealFlow and choose the object or daemon you want from the list. For this example, we will add a Liquid Emitter object and a Gravity daemon. To add a Liquid Emitter object, select it from the list and click in the viewport. A dialog box will appear where you can adjust the parameters of the emitter, such as resolution, speed, direction, etc. For this example, we will leave them as default. To add a Gravity daemon, select it from the list and click in the viewport. A dialog box will appear where you can adjust the parameters of the gravity force, such as strength, direction, etc. For this example, we will leave them as default.
 
## Step 4: Link RealFlow Objects and Daemons
 
After adding RealFlow objects and daemons to your scene, you need to link them to each other and to other objects in your scene. Linking means establishing a relationship between objects so that they can interact with each other. For example, you can link an emitter to a container so that the fluid emitted by the emitter stays inside the container.
 
To link objects in RealFlow plugin for 3ds Max 2016 30, you need to use the RFCollider modifier. The RFCollider modifier is a special modifier that allows you to turn any object into a RealFlow object and define its properties such as friction, stickiness, bounciness, etc. To add an RFCollider modifier to an object, select the object and go to Modify > Modifier List > RFCollider.
 
For this example, we will add an RFCollider modifier to the sphere and the plane. Select the sphere and go to Modify > Modifier List > RFCollider. A dialog box will appear where you can adjust the parameters of the
